# Interactive Connect4 game #

Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up, Plot Four, Find Four, Four in a Row, Four in a Line and Gravitrips) is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.

### Assumptions ###

1. An interactive text console game âœ…
2. Written in Ruby or PHP âœ…
3. Game board should be 7 columns by 6 rows âœ…
4. Show a graphical ascii representation of state of game between each move âœ…
5. Has a human player and a computer player âœ…
6. When it is playerâ€™s move: prompt for which column to drop token into âœ…
7. Indicate which moves are valid before prompting âœ…
8. Show an error message when an invalid column is given, and prompt again âœ…
9. Computer move: computer player can be dumb, but it must make a valid move âœ…
10. Detect and announce winner immediately after winning move is made âœ…
11. The software design should allow for easily replacing the computer player /
adding a new computer player - i.e. the design makes it easy to add a smart
computer player in the future, or even choose between different computer player
strategies, or have two human players, or two computer players âœ…
12. There may be opportunity to use patterns like MVC, dependency injection. Expect to see
unit testing. Prefer minimal dependencies. âœ…

### Concepts ###

- This project is well tested using `PHPUnit` testing framework.
- This project uses dependency injection using `PHP Interface` and dependency injection container using the package `php-di`.
- This project also demonstrates the use of `Abstract Class` that is inherited by the `Players Classes`.
- As a data storage, it uses the `(model) MovesStore class`  to handle the saving and validating player movements.
- Moreover, the `(view) Board class`  act as the manager to display the game movements visually.
- Finally, the `(controller) Game class`  directs the game.

#### File and Directory Structure ####

* `php-di` - The definition and configuration of dependency injection + DI container
* `src/Connect4` - A directory for all the classes used to run the game
* `src/Connect4/Game.php` - A file that links tha Players, its movements (`MovesStore class`) and how to display it (`Board class`); 
* `src/Connect4/Player` - A directory for Player related Classes
* `src/Connect4/Store` - A directory related to storing and retrieving data from the game
* `src/Connect4/View` - A directory related to displaying the movements to the user
* `tests` - A directory for project testing
* `utils` - A directory for helper functions
* `bootstrap.php` - A file that loads all the required classes for the game to run
* `main.php` - The main file that will run the game

Hey! Welcome to Connect4 game.
It is a turn-based game between two players.
Each player simply needs to enter a column number 
where they want to drop their token.
To win, they must Connect4 tokens of their own either
horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
No one wins when neither player Connect's 4 token.
--------------------------------------
The players are...
Player One: Name Human ðŸ‘¤, Token [X]
Player Two: Name Robot ðŸ¤–, Token [O]
[ ] indicates an empty cell and a valid drop point.
Have fun!
